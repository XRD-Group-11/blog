With both XRD projects done, I can now safely say I am satisfied with our group work. I am glad I took part on this team, as we could really feel everyone's passion for XR, and not simply a feel to do just about enough.
Compared to most courses, this one felt easier not because of the difficulty level, but yes because I was truly interested on it. It's always easier when the motivation comes from a passion point rather than a obligation point.
Onto the actual reflections on a programming level, I feel like VR surprised me by not being as complex as I expected, while AR surprised me for not being as simple as I expected. It was also a bit harder to come up with realistic ideas for AR, since the idea of Augmenting Reality requires us to possibly need a specific reality. For instance, one of our ideas was to create a Augmented Gym Trainer, but that would mean we needed to be at a gym, or anywhere near a gym machine, in order to be able to test our application. These are issues that only pop up with AR specifically, though I do also think AR looks extra "cooler" compared to VR.
We ended up going with a Interior Direction Provider, which in a way felt like "gamifying" real life, as we based the line on one game which I cant really recall as of now.
With VR, it was more easy to come up with a project idea. Our entire trio was composed of Counter Strike fans, so revamping CS1.6 into VR felt more like a hobby than an actual Uni Project. It was also very much entertaining to learn about how VR Games work on the behind the scenes. There were some points I had not really though of that made sense  on second though, which I would probably never found about had I not made a VR game.
With all this said, I think its safe to say I do not regret at all taking this course. In fact, I feel more safe to say that this is indeed an area I would love to work on my future.
