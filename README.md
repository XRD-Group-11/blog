• What is AR/VR/AV/MR/XR and how do the terminologies compare?
AR (Augmented Reality) : Is virtually implementing technology on real world views.
VR (Virtual Reality) : The creation of a Virtual World that we can access through some sort of Hardware.
AV (Audio-Visual) : Approaches  reality with Sound and Visuals on a preferable spot.
MR (Mixed Reality) : A mixture of AR with VR.
XR (Extended Reality) : A way to call all Reality.

• How do XR applications compare to traditional desktop and mobile applications? Advantages/disadvantages?
Any XR applications attempts to bring them to life by making it feel like reality, meanwhile your average/traditional desktop and mobile applications try to create something virtual that is not intended to feel like reality.
So Advantages is that it is more immersive, and an Disadvantage is that it might lead to some mental problems.

• What use cases does XR have?
Some possible use cases that XR has are:
- Training: It can be used to train and prepare people to real life jobs and experiences.
- Guidance:  It  can be used to guide people on a difficult or complex situation, in order to help reaching an conclusion. Eg( A surgery how-to, A GPS navigation)
- Efficiency: It can be used to make your work easier. Eg( Showing your manuals at work allowing an easier multi-tasking)
- Communication:   It can be used to ease complex communication. Eg( Trying to present a concept)

• How does XR add value to the end user?
It can be a useful tool to increase things like productivity, efficiency and more.

• How does current XR technology compare to an idealistic future vision of the technology?
Very far from the idealistic vision of a product that could be easily accessible, usable for any situation, mixing both AR and VR while maintaining each of their uniqueness. Right now the products that we have are all expensive, not really public usable, awkward to wear and currently uses a solution of Mixed Reality rather than splitting them.

• How does immersion and presence factor into XR?
They are debatably the most important factors of XR, since they are one of the things that makes it better than our usual item. They can help us immerse into something.

- How is input technology and interactions different in XR?
In XR we can still use controllers, but generally the key difference is the movement. You can move your view through your head movement, as well as walk around if wished. With some extra items you can even add tracking items that help with increasing immersion.

• What problems can XR solve?
It can solve problems with lack of efficiency, lack of understanding in certain communication contexts, lack of orientation capacity, lack of time and people to help with training.
