# Blog 5 - Idea and Implementation

## Requirements

The requirements can be found [here](https://github.com/XRD-Group-11/VR-CS-1.6/blob/main/README.md)
<br/>
The first four requirements are what we would like to have in the finished product, and the last is extra features that we would like to implement if we have the time.

## Idea

We came up with the idea of converting CS 1.6 into a VR game. With that said, CS 1.6 is not such a easy game that we could easily recreate in VR under the time constraints, so we will be doing a demo version that is:

- Offline;
- 1 Map Only (Dust2);
- 1 Gun Only (AK-47);
- Movement Mechanics (Jumping, Shift and Crouching)
- Basically gathering the assets from internet , for different sounds for example : walking , making an kill streak , gun sounds and found a map to play on.

## Assets

We have decided to use the original textures, sounds and models from the original game. This task might sound easy since we can just go to game files and copy the assets, but the original game uses specific file extensions. In the end we have found the `de_dust2` map on the internet in `.obj` format with all of the textures. The sounds we have pulled from the original game files and the gun model we have converted from `.mdl` to `.fbx` using a blender plugin.

## Implementation

When it comes to implementation, for now. The Dust2 map is integrated along with AK-47, it is possible to move around the map and that is about it. Also, we have modeled the AK-47 to have a detachable magazine inside the blender.
